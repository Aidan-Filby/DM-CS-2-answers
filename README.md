## Maths
If you wish to include some maths that GitHub doesn't support, use https://tex-image-link-generator.herokuapp.com/ to encode it into a form GH understands. (This site simply puts a image sourced from the GitHub maths renderer site with the url encoded properly). I recommend wrapping the block in `\color{#888}{ ... }` so it is visible in both light and dark mode.
